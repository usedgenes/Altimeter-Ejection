Rocket is going ~50 m/s at 790 feet.
Want the altimeter to be going around -20 m/s to be safe, want this to occur in around 0.5 seconds
Using kinematics equations:
Initial velocity = 50
Final velocity = -20
Time = 0.5

Solve for acceleration -> -110 m/s^2

Weight of whole mechanism: 100 grams at most

F = ma
F = -110*0.1 = 11 Newtons

Springs I'm using: https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Compression-Stainless-Compressed-Capacity/dp/B08FDXRFTP/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3UAK8LPE18D8M&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kEGilpG9k5LnFp2rj4KkDDRss-UBsOuTW50MwYEawJ1WdyPu4FgzBZv9aDZHuHarcVjLdIXNJWI9p3OI0IQqmsOxYOZynUYuNjV4WzzVknFIofhT-i5Fuqzb5oKHKksf6lbxj_CfhFJyN40giR5I_b39bOYW8tCDbFeSbd2pi97UkvOK8oCMETfOx9kRWg-gYzBYH2aqu8E8Zon5ujwVLhWb4nzBq26par8Vggm8GtY.3Z1MngWldSurwUjY0MFNMw9jn_TvUnCmaqreuRN0GUY&dib_tag=se&keywords=uxcell%2B70mm%2Bspring&qid=1724560350&sprefix=uxcell%2B70mm%2Bspr%2Caps%2C313&sr=8-1&th=1
66.4N Load Capacity, 1.66 N/mm spring rate
If I use two of the springs, I should have more than enough force to successfully eject the altimeter.

Actual velocity:

10.053 seconds - around 1.5 inch mark
10.116 seconds - around 12 inch mark

Change in distance: 10.5 inches
Change in time: 0.063 seconds

Velocity = 13.8889 ft/s = 4.233 m/s



Second test:
3.86 seconds - 0 cm mark
3.87 seconds - around 10cm mark

Around 10 m/s

Weighs 18 grams right now
But if I get it down to 12 grams, then using conservation of momentum, 0.018*10 = v * 0.012 
v = 15 m/s
