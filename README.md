# Altimeter Ejection
 
This is a project to manually eject an altimeter from a model rocket at a predetermined altitude in order to get a desired reading from the altimeter. 

It uses a servo to block a spring from pushing on the container with the altimeter in it, and once the flight computer detects that the rocket is at the desired height, it retracts the servo, allowing the spring to push the altimeter out. 

Parts: 
	-BMP388 Altimeter
	-ESP32 
	-SD Card (for data logging)
	-SG-90 Servo
	-70mm long spring, 33N
	-7.4V Li-Po battery for power
	-Various 3D-printed parts
